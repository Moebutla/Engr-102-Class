# Engr-102-Class
Programs written during Engr 102 Class using Python

These programs were during my first semester learning code. While the class was not an actual coding class,
I did learn a lot about Python and coding in general.

Note: I have only included the code I did for individual projects and not anything that was a part of a group for the time being.
